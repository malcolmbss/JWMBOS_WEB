      Note: If you are looking for the <b>LifeFamily Church</b> web site... this <b><i>is not</i></b> it.  This is a test site prototype for possible future updates to the web site.  The official
      LifeFamily website is <a href="https://Life.Family">https://Life.Family</a>

      <h2>Project Mission, Objectives, Caveats, & Disclaimers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The objective is <b>not</b> to design a new web site and/or mobile app.  The objective is to create a framework for storing, accessing, retrieving, & notifying users
        with information related to all events, past and future, for LifeFamily Church.
        <li>Where a new/modified web site might result down the road, again, that is not in the current scope of this project.
        <li>The prototype website is <b>not</b> real. Other than specific items on the pages specifically related to the prototype work, the remainder is a 'movie-set' representing the real Life.Family site. There are items <b>missing</b>.  Ignore it.
        <li>The UI/UX of the new function is <b>irrelevant</b> to the design.  The purpose of the web presentation is not to show <b>how</b> it should appear, rather to show what this new function
        <b>can do</b>.  Signicant additional UI/UX design will occur later in the process to determine how all of this will look and act.
        <li>The new navigation tree on the left is a <b>suggestion</b>.  We are not proposing a final complete tree structure.
             The design is a <b>framework</b>.  The design intent is that authorized admin users can create / delete / move nodes in the tree.
        <li>Content for each node will be generated by the individual ministries.
        <li>The current tree shows what 'could' be.  Once in production, empty nodes will not appear.  For example, if one campus does not have any content for LifeMen ministry, that node will
            not appear for that campus.
        <li>Security roles will also protect certain sensitive or private nodes/content.
        <li>Every node in the entire navigation tree 'can' have it's own separate <b>subscribable</b> calendar.  Calendar events in lower nodes can be shared with other nodes by the calendar event creator.
        <li>When a user subscribes to a calendar on their mobile device or google calendar, all subsequent updates to the calendar will automatically appear on the user's mobile device calendar or google calendar.
        <li>In the current prototype, only <b>"Southwest Campus LifeMen"</b> is active on the side bar Navigation tree. To view LifeMen page:
           <ul>
              <li>Go to the prototype using the button below
              <li>Scroll down the new Site Navigation side bar
              <li>Navigate to & click: <b>LifeFamily&rarr;Campuses&rarr;Austin (Southwest-Main)&rarr;Ministries&rarr;LifeMen</b>
              <li>The LifeMen calendar is <b><i>REAL</i></b> You can really <b>subscribe</b> to this calendar using instructions in the popup (although the calendar is not yet officially representing the Southwest Campus LifeMen ministry)
              <li>Only admins can add events to the calendar.  But added events should appear on all subscribed devices.
           </ul>
         <li>In the current prototype, the search bar is not functional.
      </ul>
